# Minesweeper-2
i redid minesweeper so i coud simply have a version of it working. alot needs to be done for it to suit the assignment better but i was able to learn how i wanted to get the 
code working

i need to seperate the code in to different classes next to make sure things work. i spent time on that today but only ended up braeking everything so far.
tomorrow i will take a better crack at making the code dry, and flow better. but for now i have the bear minimum of functions working.

the repo name is minesweeper 2 because it was my 2nd build of it. i did this one from scratch simply to prove i could handle the logic of the game.
i need to do a 3rd version where i clean up the code still.

repo link: https://github.com/BenGlase/Minesweeper-2

the game only runs when ran on a live server.
